# SoftwareRendering

This is a simple software rendering engine that I wrote within 2 weeks.
Basicly it achieves these goals:

- Space transformation
- Draw Triangle using Gouraud scan-line based method
- Perspective Texture Mapping
- Ambient light and a single directional light
- CVV Clipping(Homogeneous Coordinate Clipping)
